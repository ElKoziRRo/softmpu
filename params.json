It's designed to work in tandem with the MIDI interfaces found on\r\nSound Blaster and other common sound cards.\r\n\r\n### WHY'S THIS USEFUL?\r\n\r\nGames from the late 80s and early 90s that support music via the Roland\r\nMT-32/CM-32L often expect to find a hardware MPU-401 interface that supports\r\n'intelligent mode'. These are now expensive and difficult to find.\r\n\r\nBy supporting the 'intelligent mode' features in software, these games will\r\nwork with the basic MIDI interfaces found on sound cards.\r\n\r\n### REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n- EMM386 4.46+ (MS-DOS 6.2) or QEMM 7.03+\r\n- Sound Blaster (or compatible) sound card (MPU-401 & SB-MIDI mode)\r\n- Serial port (Serial MIDI mode)\r\n\r\n### USING SOFTMPU: MPU-401 & SB-MIDI MODE\r\n\r\nRun SoftMPU specifying the base port address and interrupt of your Sound\r\nBlaster, and the base port address of the MPU-401 interface, e.g.\r\n\r\n  `SOFTMPU.EXE /SB:220 /IRQ:5 /MPU:330`\r\n\r\nThe optional `/OUTPUT:SBMIDI` switch forces Sound Blaster MIDI to be used. This\r\nmode is intended for use with the Sound Blaster Pro 2 and other sound cards\r\nwithout a hardware MPU-401 interface. Game compatibility may be reduced.\r\n\r\n### USING SOFTMPU: SERIAL MIDI MODE\r\n\r\nRun SoftMPU specifying the serial interface to be used and the base port\r\naddress of the MPU-401 interface, e.g.\r\n\r\n  `SOFTMPU.EXE /MPU:330 /OUTPUT:COM1`\r\n\r\nA Sound Blaster base port address and IRQ can optionally be specified if\r\nMPU-401 interrupts are required.\r\n\r\n### FURTHER OPTIONS\r\n\r\nThe optional `/DELAYSYSEX` switch enables small transmission delays to prevent\r\nbuffer overflow with the Rev.0 MT-32.\r\n\r\nThe optional `/RA50` switch enables simulated \"All Notes Off\" commands for\r\ncompatibility with the Roland RA-50.\r\n\r\nSoftMPU will remain active until the PC is restarted. It occupies\r\napproximately 8KB and can be loaded into high memory using the LH command.\r\n\r\n### TROUBLESHOOTING\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  When using a PS/2 mouse, moving the cursor causes slow playback.\r\n**Solution:** Use a mouse driver that supports direct hardware access e.g.\r\n              CuteMouse 2.0 (but not 2.1).\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  Some games expect to find an MPU interface on IRQ 2, but my sound\r\n              but my sound card doesn't support it.\r\n**Solution:** Configure your sound card to use IRQ 9.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  SoftMPU can't find a hardware MPU interface when using a Sound\r\n              Blaster Pro 2 or older sound card.\r\n**Solution**: Run SoftMPU with the `/OUTPUT:SBMIDI` switch.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  My Rev.0 MT-32 displays \"EXC. BUFFER OVERFLOW\". Music playback sounds incorrect.\r\n**Solution:** Run SoftMPU with the `/DELAYSYSEX` switch.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  Music playback stops working after running a specific program.\r\n**Solution:** Restart your PC. Software that reprograms the Real-Time Clock will\r\n              stop SoftMPU from working correctly.\r\n\r\n### FURTHER INFO\r\n\r\nFor compatibility information and serial MIDI cable pinouts, please see\r\n[http://github.com/bjt42/softmpu/wiki](http://github.com/bjt42/softmpu/wiki).\r\n\r\n### BUILDING SOFTMPU\r\n\r\nMicrosoft C 6.0A & MASM 6.11 are required (earlier versions may work, but are\r\nuntested).\r\n\r\nThe default install directories are C:\\C600 and C:\\MASM611. You will need to\r\nedit BUILD.BAT if you have selected different install directories.\r\n\r\nRun BUILD.BAT to build SOFTMPU.EXE in the current directory.\r\n\r\n### DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nSoftMPU is distributed under the GNU General Public License. Please read\r\nLICENSE for further information.\r\n\r\n### SPECIAL THANKS\r\n\r\n- The DOSBox Team for their intelligent mode MPU-401 emulation code. SoftMPU\r\n  couldn't exist without it!\r\n- Forum members at www.vogons.org for their encouragement and advice :)","google":"UA-41968860-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
