It's designed to work in tandem with the MPU interface found on\r\nthe Sound Blaster 16 and other common sound cards.\r\n\r\n### WHY'S THIS USEFUL?\r\n\r\nGames from the late 80s and early 90s that support music via the Roland\r\nMT-32/CM-32L often expect to find a hardware MPU interface that supports\r\n'intelligent mode'. These are now expensive and difficult to find.\r\n\r\nBy supporting the 'intelligent mode' features in software, these games will\r\nwork with the basic MPU interface found on sound cards.\r\n\r\n### REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n- EMM386 4.46+ (MS-DOS 6.2) or QEMM 7.03+ must be loaded\r\n- Sound Blaster (or compatible) sound card with an MPU-401 interface\r\n  supporting UART mode (e.g. Sound Blaster 16/AWE, Yamaha YMF71x)\r\n- Roland LA synth (e.g. MT-32, CM-32L) or a sound card with MT-32 emulation\r\n\r\n### USING SOFTMPU\r\n\r\nRun SoftMPU specifying the base I/O port address and interrupt of your Sound\r\nBlaster, and the base I/O port address of your hardware MPU interface, e.g.\r\n\r\n  `SOFTMPU.EXE /SB:220 /IRQ:5 /MPU:330`\r\n\r\nThe optional `/DELAYSYSEX` switch enables small transmission delays to prevent\r\nbuffer overflow with the Rev.0 MT-32.\r\n\r\nThe optional `/RA50` switch enables simulated \"All Notes Off\" commands for\r\ncompatibility with the Roland RA-50.\r\n\r\nSoftMPU will remain active until the PC is restarted. It occupies\r\napproximately 8KB and can be loaded into high memory using the LH command.\r\n\r\n### TROUBLESHOOTING\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  When using a PS/2 mouse, moving the cursor causes slow playback.\r\n**Solution:** Use a mouse driver that supports direct hardware access e.g.\r\n              CuteMouse 2.0 (but not 2.1).\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  Some games expect to find an MPU interface on IRQ 2, but my sound\r\n              but my sound card doesn't support it.\r\n**Solution:** Use IRQ 9 instead. This is supported by Yamaha YMF71x sound cards,\r\n              maybe others too.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  My Rev.0 MT-32 displays \"EXC. BUFFER OVERFLOW\". Music playback\r\n              card doesn't support it.\r\n**Solution:** Run SoftMPU with the `/DELAYSYSEX` switch.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  Music playback stops working after running a specific program.\r\n**Solution:** Restart your PC. Software that reprograms the Real-Time Clock will\r\n              stop SoftMPU from working correctly.\r\n\r\n### FURTHER INFO\r\n\r\nFor game compatibility information, please see\r\n[http://github.com/bjt42/softmpu/wiki](http://github.com/bjt42/softmpu/wiki).\r\n\r\n### BUILDING SOFTMPU\r\n\r\nMicrosoft C 6.0A & MASM 6.11 are required (earlier versions may work, but are\r\nuntested).\r\n\r\nThe default install directories are C:\\C600 and C:\\MASM611. You will need to\r\nedit BUILD.BAT if you have selected different install directories.\r\n\r\nRun BUILD.BAT to build SOFTMPU.EXE in the current directory.\r\n\r\n### DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nSoftMPU is distributed under the GNU General Public License. Please read\r\nLICENSE for further information.\r\n\r\n### SPECIAL THANKS\r\n\r\n- The DOSBox Team for their intelligent mode MPU-401 emulation code. SoftMPU\r\n  couldn't exist without it!\r\n- Forum members at www.vogons.org for their encouragement and advice :)","google":"UA-41968860-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
